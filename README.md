# web-assignment

Well, this is my code assignment for the application at the Social Brothers.

For this assignment I used the following packages:

  - Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
  - Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite
  - Swashbuckle.AspNetCore

I didn't manage to finish part 3, due to not having a credit card avaliable sign up 
for the free API in question. Other then that part 1 and 2 are working and monkey
tested.

The code itself is of decent quality, with the main thing of note being the use of a
repository pattern in order to have one place with all the database calls. The main
issue with this code is most likely security, I don't have much experience on that
front.
